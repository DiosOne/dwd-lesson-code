# Number Below 100

# Write a function that asks the user to input a number from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
# If the user supplies a value outside that range, the function should print an error message and prompt the user to try again.
# Once the user successfully enters an acceptable number, the function should return that value.

# Keep all of your input() statements inside the loop!

# Don't worry about dealing with user inputs that aren't integers just yet, we'll save that for another challenge.
