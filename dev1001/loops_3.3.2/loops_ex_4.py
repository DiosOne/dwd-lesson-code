# Sum To End

# Write a function that repeatedly asks the user for an integer, adding that number to a total each time, until the user gives the input "end".
# When the user tells the function to end, it should return the sum of all the numbers the user entered.

# Keep all of your input statements inside the loop!

# Don't worry about what happens if the user gives strings other than "end" for now - we'll tackle that in a later challenge.


def sum_of_inputs():
    total = 0

    # your code here...

    return total
