# Sum To X

# Great work on that last challenge. Can you modify your code to make it more powerful please?
# Specifically, can you make it so that the function calculates the sum of all integers up to (and including) a target value, which is specified as an argument?

# For example:

#     sum_to_x(3) outputs 6 (the sum of 1, 2 and 3)

#     sum_to_x(4) outputs 10 (the sum of 1, 2, 3, and 4)

#     sum_to_x(100) outputs 5050 (the sum of every integer up to and including 100)


def sum_to_x(target_integer):
    count = 0
    result = 0

# ... your code here...

    return result
