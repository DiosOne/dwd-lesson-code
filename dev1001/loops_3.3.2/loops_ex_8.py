# Search Through List

# Use a for loop to write a function that will accept a string as its argument,
# and filter the supplied list of words for elements that contain that string. It should return the filtered list.
# If there are none it should return an empty list.

# Use the list of words supplied in the scaffold.

# For example, the input "ph" would return:

# ["pluviophile", "euphoria"]

# And the input "aaa" would return:

# []
